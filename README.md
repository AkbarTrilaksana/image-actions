# Image Actions

Image Actions automatically compress JPEG, PNG and WebP images in GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Fast, efficient and near-lossless compression**
- Uses the best image compression algorithms available: [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)
- Configurable and extensible: use default settings or adapt to your needs
- Runs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Built by web performance experts at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/); a  performance monitoring platform

## Installation

Create the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file with the following configuration

```yml
name: Compress images
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

_The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is [automatically generated by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). This automatic token is [scoped only to the repository that is currently running the action.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#token-permissions)_

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```yml
...
- name: Compress Images
  uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    jpegQuality: "80"
    pngQuality: "80"
    webpQuality: "80"
    ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,build"
    # No spaces allowed
```

If you would like to modify the defaults, update the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file by adding arguments to the action:

- [jpegQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [pngQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [webpQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- `ignorePaths`: a comma separated string with [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) support of paths to ignore when looking for images to compress

_The `jpegQuality`, `pngQuality` and `webpQuality` config keys will be delivered directly into [sharp’s](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) `toFormat` method._

Previous versions of image-actions used `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration. We suggest that you migrate to the newest configuration format by reading the [migration steps](#migration-legacy-configuration) below.

### Running the action only when images are changed

image-actions is designed to run for each Pull Request. In some repositories, images are seldom updated. To run the action only when images have changed, use GitHub Action’s [`on.push.paths`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) workflow configuration:

```yml
name: Compress images
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.jpg'
      - '**.png'
      - '**.webp'
```

The above workflow will only run on a pull request when `jpg`, `png` or `webp` files are changed.

## Migrate legacy configuration

- uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions

    If your calibreapp-image-actions.yml file has a reference to `docker://` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` like below

    ```yml
    - name: calibreapp/image-actions
       uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

    Update your configuration to match the following

    ```yml
    - name: Compress images
      uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
      with:
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

- `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml`

    If your repository uses `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration, it should be moved into  `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml`. Then delete the `image-actions.yml` file.

    `ignorePaths` is no longer an array and is now a comma separated list. eg: `ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,bin"`
