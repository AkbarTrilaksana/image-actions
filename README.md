# Image actions

Image actions will automatically compress jpeg and png images in GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Compression is fast, efficient and lossless**
- Uses mozjpeg + libvips, the best image compression available
- Runs in GitHub Actions **for free**

## How to add this to your repository:

- Add the following steps to a workflow file found at: `.github/main.workflow` (If you donâ€™t have one, create it.)
- Paste in the following:

```workflow
workflow "Compress images" {
  resolves = ["calibreapp/image-actions"]
  on = "pull_request"
}

action "calibreapp/image-actions" {
  uses = "calibreapp/image-actions@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

This action requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` so that it has access to commit the optimised images to your repository.
