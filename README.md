# Image Actions

Image Actions automatically compress JPEG, PNG and WebP images in GitHub Pull Requests within the same repository.

It can also run in "Compress Only" mode to allow this to be used for non-Pull Requests, and also for Pull Requests from forks.

- **Fast, efficient and near-lossless compression**
- Uses the best image compression algorithms available: [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)
- Configurable and extensible: use default settings or adapt to your needs
- Runs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Built by web performance experts at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/); a  performance monitoring platform

## Installation

Create the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file with the following configuration

```yml
name: Compress images
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    # Only run on Pull Requests within the same repository, and not from forks
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

_The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is [automatically generated by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). This automatic token is [scoped only to the repository that is currently running the action.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#token-permissions). What this means is that by default the Action cannot update pull requests initiated from forked repositories._

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```yml
...
- name: Compress Images
  uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    jpegQuality: "80"
    pngQuality: "80"
    webpQuality: "80"
    ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,build"
    # No spaces allowed
    compressOnly: "false"
```

If you would like to modify the defaults, update the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file by adding arguments to the action:

- [jpegQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [pngQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [webpQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- `ignorePaths`: a comma separated string with [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) support of paths to ignore when looking for images to compress
- `compressOnly`: Boolean, true or false, default false

_The `jpegQuality`, `pngQuality` and `webpQuality` config keys will be delivered directly into [sharp’s](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) `toFormat` method._

The markdown added to a pull request is outputted to `markdown` output parameter. In that case it is advised to add an `id` attribute to reference this (see [Handling pull requests from forked repos](./#handling-pull-requests-from-forked-repos) example below).

Previous versions of image-actions used `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration. We suggest that you migrate to the newest configuration format by reading the [migration steps](#migration-legacy-configuration) below.

### Running the action only when images are changed

image-actions is designed to run for each Pull Request. In some repositories, images are seldom updated. To run the action only when images have changed, use GitHub Action’s [`on.push.paths`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) workflow configuration:

```yml
name: Compress images
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.jpg'
      - '**.png'
      - '**.webp'
```

The above workflow will only run on a pull request when `jpg`, `png` or `webp` files are changed.

## Running just the compression

By default this Action will add the updated image to the current pull request. It is also possible to set the `compressOnly` option to `true` to skip the commit, if you want to handle this separately - including for forks - see below.

```yml
      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: "true"
```

## Handling pull requests from forked repos

GitHub actions, by default, do not have permission to alter forked repositories. This means this action, by default, only works for pull requests from branches in the same repository as the destination branch.

You can replace the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a [personal access token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token) which does have permission for forked repositaries, but this introduces other security considerations (which is why it not available by default).

Alternatively you can run this action only for Pull Requests for the current repo, which is advised when not using PATs to avoid wasting time and compute for compressions that will not be committed using the following syntax (as shown in the example yml files in this README):

```
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
```

It is also possible to run an addition instance of this action in `compressOnly` mode on pushes to master, and then raise a new pull request for any images commited from a forked repositary pull request as shown in the below example which uses the [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub Action to open this new Pull Request (note this only raises a Pull Request if any fules are changed).


```yml
name: Compress images on Push to Master
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Compress Images
        id: calibre
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: "true"

      - name: Create New Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@master
        with:
          title: Compressed Images
          branch-suffix: timestamp
          commit-message: Compressed Images
          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}
```

## Migrate legacy configuration

- uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions

    If your calibreapp-image-actions.yml file has a reference to `docker://` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` like below

    ```yml
    - name: calibreapp/image-actions
       uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

    Update your configuration to match the following

    ```yml
    - name: Compress images
      uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
      with:
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

- `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml`

    If your repository uses `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration, it should be moved into  `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml`. Then delete the `image-actions.yml` file.

    `ignorePaths` is no longer an array and is now a comma separated list. eg: `ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,bin"`
