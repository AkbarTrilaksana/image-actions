- **Compression is fast, efficient and lossless**
- Uses mozjpeg + libvips, the best image compression available
- Runs in GitHub Actions, so it's visible to everyone

## How to add this to your repository:

- Add the following steps to a workflow file found at: `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` (If you donâ€™t have one, create it.)
- Paste in the following:

```yml
name: Compress images
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: calibreapp/image-actions
        uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This action requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret so that it has access to commit the optimised images to your repository.
