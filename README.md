# Image Actions

Image Actions automatically compresses JPEG, PNG and WebP images in GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Fast, efficient and near-lossless compression**
- Uses the best image compression algorithms available: [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)
- [Configurable](#Configuration) and extensible: use default settings or adapt to your needs
- Runs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Built by web performance experts at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/); a performance monitoring platform

## Installation

Create the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file with the following configuration:

```yml
name: Compress images
on:
  pull_request:
    # Run image-actions when jpg, jpeg, png or webp files are added or changed
    # See https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths
    paths:
      - "**.jpg"
      - "**.jpeg"
      - "**.png"
      - "**.webp"
jobs:
  build:
    # Only run on Pull Requests within the same repository, and not from forks
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

_The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is [automatically generated by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). This automatic token is [scoped only to the repository that is currently running the action.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#token-permissions). What this means is that by default the Action cannot update pull requests initiated from forked repositories._

## Configuration

By default image actions will compress images so that theyâ€™re smaller and will leave your assets looking clear and crisp. If you want to change those defaults, read on.

Previous versions of image-actions used `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration. We suggest that you migrate to the newest configuration format by reading the [migration steps](#migration-legacy-configuration) below.

## Image quality settings

Set custom configuration by adding arguments to the action workflow definition:

```yml
...
- name: Compress Images
  uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    jpegQuality: "80"
    jpegProgressive: false
    pngQuality: "80"
    webpQuality: "80"
    ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,build"
    # No spaces allowed
    compressOnly: false
```

Options:

- [jpegQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [pngQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [webpQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string
- [jpegProgressive](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Boolean, true or false, default false
- `ignorePaths`: a comma separated string with [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) support of paths to ignore when looking for images to compress
- `compressOnly`: Boolean, true or false, default false


## Running just the compression

By default this Action will add the updated image(s) to the current pull request. It is also possible to set the `compressOnly` option to `true` to skip the commit, if you want to handle this separately - including for forks - see below.

```yml
      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: true
```

## Handling pull requests from forked repos

GitHub actions, by default, do not have permission to alter forked repositories. This means this action, by default, only works for pull requests from branches in the same repository as the destination branch.

You can replace the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a [personal access token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token) which does have permission for forked repositaries, but this introduces other security considerations (which is why it not available by default).

Alternatively you can run this action only for Pull Requests for the current repo, which is advised when not using PATs to avoid wasting time and compute for compressions that will not be committed using the following syntax (as shown in the example yml files in this README):

```
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
```

It is also possible to run an addition instance of this action in `compressOnly` mode on pushes to master, and then raise a new pull request for any images commited from a forked repositary pull request. This is shown in the below example which uses the [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub Action to open this new Pull Request (note this only raises a Pull Request if any files are actually changed in previous steps).

```yml
name: Compress images on Push to Master
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Compress Images
        id: calibre
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: true
      - name: Create New Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@master
        with:
          title: Compressed Images
          branch-suffix: timestamp
          commit-message: Compressed Images
          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}
```

## Compressing images on a schedule

Similar to above, it is also possible to run an addition instance of this action in `compressOnly` mode at specific times, and then raise a new pull request for any images compressed.

```yml
name: Compress images at 11pm and open a pull request
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '* 23 * * *'
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Compress Images
        id: calibre
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: true
      - name: Create New Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@master
        with:
          title: Compressed Images Nightly
          branch-suffix: timestamp
          commit-message: Compressed Images
          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}
```

## Migrate legacy configuration

- uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions

    If your calibreapp-image-actions.yml file has a reference to `docker://` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` as follows:

    ```yml
    - name: calibreapp/image-actions
       uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

    Update your configuration to:

    ```yml
    - name: Compress images
      uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
      with:
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

- `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml`

    If your repository uses `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration, it should be moved into  `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml`. Then delete the `image-actions.yml` file.

    `ignorePaths` is no longer an array and is now a comma separated list. eg: `ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,bin"`
